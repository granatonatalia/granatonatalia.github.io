## Code Style and Conventions

### HTML

- Include proper accessibility attributes (`aria-label`, `role`, etc.)
- Maintain consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Use descriptive class names in English

## Design Patterns

### Theme System
- Themes controlled via `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`
- CSS variables defined in `:root` and `[data-theme="dark"]`
- Theme preference stored in localStorage
- Toggle button with appropriate icons (üåô/‚òÄÔ∏è)

- Elements fade in and slide up when entering viewport
- Hover effects on interactive elements

4. **Skills**: Categorized technical skills (Frontend, Backend)
